    <h1>Fall guys</h1>
   <ul>
    <li>the best game i ever played it is very fun .</li>
    <li> i really enjoy playing this game and it is so fun and cool and the cracters are so cute.</li>
    <li> this game uis something elas it is really fun when you play this game whit a squad it is really funny they bway that your cracter run.</li>
    <li>Fall Guys takes inspiration from several sources, but its biggest influences are TV game shows in the vein of Wipeout. Each match, or “show” as the game refers to them, is comprised of several rounds. Each round is designed to whittle down the group of 60 players until there is only one left standing. While many battle royale confrontations can last up to over a half-hour depending on a player’s skill level, a show in Fall Guys will only ever take between 10 and 15 minutes, making for an addictive “just one more” experience.</li>
    <li>Making the game even more accessible to a broader player base is the simplicity of its controls. Aside from moving your character, the only things you need to worry about are jumping, diving, and grabbing. There’s no loadout to manage or meta gameplay, like building in Fortnite or buying equipment in Warzone, to deal with. Most of the maps will require the use of all three skills. While on the surface, this may seem to make for very shallow gameplay, the more you play, the more you’ll find certain strategies and opportunities to use specific moves that may not have been apparent at first glance.</li>
    <li>The real issues with Fall Guys, however, are on the back end. For the first week, the game was littered with server problems due to its popularity. It meant that many players weren’t able to connect, and the servers for the game were routinely taken down for maintenance. Even if you did get into a game, sometimes the rounds would be unplayable.

        The game Tip Toe, which asks you to get to the finish via a large grid of tiles — some safe, others that collapse if stepped on — had a game-breaking bug for me in the first two weeks of release. If I moved too quickly, I would slide as if the tiles were covered in oil, and would consistently fly off the board. Despite my best efforts, I never won a single game of Tip Toe before the issue was patched</li>
    <li>Everyone on my social media is talking about the game, sharing clips of either incredible victories or devastating losses. The Fall Guys’ Twitter account has been killing it with its posts, and is currently auctioning off in-game cosmetics to the highest bidder for charity.

        The zeitgeist around the game is bountiful and a pleasure to be a part of, something that cannot usually be said about most games. It means that you shouldn’t wait to play, even though the game appears to have plenty of legs for months and years to come.</li>
   </ul>
 <h1> GTA V </h1>
   <ul>
    <li>There are times when I look at Los Santos and think 'why would you even think to build that?' This is, appropriately, a thought that I often have about Los Angeles. In GTA 5's case, the tone is different: baffled wonderment as opposed to baffled, y'know, despair. Rockstar have created one of the most extraordinary game environments you will ever visit. I look at it and I wonder at the vast expense of effort required to render every trash bag in every back alley just so. I marvel at the care evident in San Andreas' gorgeous sunsets, in the way that sunglasses subtly alter the colour balance of the world, in the artfully-chosen selection of licensed music designed to accompany your experience. Everything about Los Santos demonstrates the extraordinary amount of thought and love poured into it by hundreds of developers over many years. The abiding irony of Grand Theft Auto 5 is that everybody who actually lives in Los Santos hates it there.

    </li>
    <li>This is the most beautiful, expansive and generous GTA game and also, by some distance, the nastiest and most nihilistic. Rockstar went through a phase, in Bully, Grand Theft Auto IV and the sadly console-bound Red Dead Redemption, of framing their protagonists as anti-heroes. GTA 4's Niko Bellic did some terrible things, but he had a downtrodden charm that helped you like him as you piloted him through the underworld. He was surrounded by people who were larger-than-life but ultimately, beneath the surface, people. Among those people were some of Rockstar's better female characters—Kate McReary, Mallorie Bardas, The Lost and Damned's Ash Butler.</li>
    <li>Grand Theft Auto 5 does away with all of that, deliberately but to its detriment. Its trio of protagonists occupy a city full of vapid, two-dimensional caricatures, and they flirt with that boundary themselves. Michael is a middle-aged former bankrobber, unhappily married and on the edge of a breakdown. Franklin is a young hood, purportedly principled but willing to do almost anything for money. Trevor is a desert-dwelling, meth-dealing psychopath with a homebrew morality that sits uneasily alongside his capacity for violent cruelty and sexual aggression. The campaign explores their relationship through a series of heists and misadventures as they clash with every L.A. stereotype you might imagine—the bored Beverly Hills housewife, the corrupt fed, the bottom-rung fraudster, the smug technology exec, and so on.</li>

       <h1>WITCHER</h1>  
   <ul>
    <li>Don't be afraid of change. Even though The Witcher may scare off some people with inventive combat that replaces comfortable old rapid-fire clicking with rhythmic sword swinging, there is no need to avoid one of the deepest, most adult role-playing games to hit the PC in years. Polish developer CD Projekt has crafted one of those landmark games that moves the goalposts for everybody, a truly grown-up take on swords and sorcery that breaks just about every fantasy tradition in the book. Once you experience a grimy medieval world so realistic that you can practically smell it, quests that reject simplistic good and evil for ambiguous "decisions and consequences," and, yes, newfangled battle mechanics that add welcome twists to left-click scrapping, you'll find it awfully hard to go back to the usual D&D rip-off</li>
    <li>Built on a 2007 edition of the Aurora Engine that powers Neverwinter Nights, The Witcher is something of a cross between action RPGs such as Diablo and more complex plate-mail potboilers such as Neverwinter Nights. Essentially, the developers work both sides of the street. On the one hand, you have exactly one character choice in the form of greasy-haired Geralt of Rivia, the monster-hunting mercenary "witcher" of the title, along with other ostensibly dumbed-down features such as big bunches of combat and Gatling-gun-quick leveling up. But on the other hand, you also get a postwar fantasy world called Temeria that feels lived in (if not postapocalyptic), as well as plot points that involve serious moral choices. Story and setting have been borrowed from The Last Wish, a Polish fantasy novel published way back in 1990 by Andrzej Sapkowski, and for once such an adaptation has been pulled off successfully.</li>
    <li>Although there is a fair bit of saving-the-world RPG claptrap involving a powerful evil mage and a mysterious group called the Salamanders, you deal with a lot of lowlifes. Woman-hating religious fanatics; merchants who deal in abducted children; slatternly bar wenches who'll bed down with you for a bottle of wine; witches who sell poison and play with voodoo dolls; racists who openly hate nonhumans and threaten to kill elves and dwarves. Make no mistake: Although there are a lot of traditional, Gygaxian monsters on the prowl here--barghests, wargs, ghouls, drowned undead, vampires, wraiths, wyverns, and loads of different demons--the biggest enemy that Geralt faces is always his fellow humans. You're not much of a hero, either. Requests for assistance can be turned down. Money is always a factor, even when you decide to be a good guy and lend a helping hand. And you have no problem taking advantage of just about every woman you encounter, having pre-marital relations with a handful of babes in every act of the game despite apparently being in love with one of your fellow witchers.</li>

    <h1> FORZA HORIZON</h1>
    <li>As Forza Horizon 5 crosses the finish line, the bar for open-world racing has again been raised in so many different ways. A map of Mexico that’s bigger, higher, and wildly more varied than any Horizon game yet. A fresh change to the way the Horizon Festival itself is gradually constructed, which results in more one-off events deliberately designed to showcase Horizon 5 at its very best. Improved tools that allow us to build completely custom events that can be more or less indistinguishable from those crafted by the developers themselves.

    </li>
    <li>An enormous visual upgrade, especially to lighting, tyre smoke, and dust effects. Hundreds and hundreds of new custom parts, rims, and performance mods, and cars with more character than ever. Drastic sound improvements, better handling, more granular preferences and options, more online activities. It really is incredible across the board.</li>
    <li>To understand just how big Forza Horizon 5 is, we have to briefly look back at Forza Horizon 4, which truly ballooned into an absolute colossus of a racing game back in 2018. Playground Games had taken the impeccable open-world racing of all the Horizon games to date, then stuffed in simulated seasons, a shared-world multiplayer overhaul, and a shift in how the team told their mini automotive stories. But that was day one; Playground then spent another three years cramming in even more things to do. The Festival Playlist, where new activities were available every week. The Eliminator, Horizon’s very clever and effective take on bringing the battle royale format to a racing game. The Super7, where we could participate in custom-built racing, driving, and stunt-based challenges made by others, plus create and share our own.</li>
   </ul>

    <h1> OPRATION CHIMERA</h1>
    <li>In Operation Chimera, two new Operators join Team Rainbow to help contain a mysterious parasite infection that hit a small town in New Mexico. To safeguard the perimeter, Six selected the most qualified biohazard specialists in the world: Lion and Finka.</li>
    <li>Outbreak’s three player coop mode will force you to revisit your strategies and push you to rely on teammates like never before. The infected hostiles outnumber you on every front, and your only way out alive is through innovative tactics that will give you an edge. Your team will be composed of three of the following Operators: Ash, Tachanka, Doc, Smoke, Buck, Kapkan, Glaz, Ying, Finka, Lion and Recruit. The loadout of Outbreak Operators will also be tweaked to incorporate gadgets that favor melee combat. The flashbangs will allow for special takedown combinations, and smoke grenades will encourage chaos that will thin out your enemies. Outbreak will bring the tension of CQC to another level.</li>
